# Bioinformatics
Library with some of the bioinformatics' algorithms, taken from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/users/Xorboo/) tasks:
- String algorithms
- Alignments:
  * Edit distance alignment
  * Global alignment with scoring matrix
  * Global alignment with constant gap penalty
  * Global alignment with scoring matrix and affine gap penalty
  * Local alignment with affine gap penalty
- DNA-RNA-Amino acids conversions. JSON is used for storin amino acids information (using Newtonsoft.Json for parsing)
- Other smaller tasks

Not all algorithms are optimal, some use simple brute force methods.
